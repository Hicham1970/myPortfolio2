A draft survey is a critical maritime procedure used to determine the weight of cargo loaded or unloaded from a vessel by measuring its displacement. This post introduces the fundamentals of draft surveys.

## What is a Draft Survey?

A draft survey is a method used in the maritime industry to calculate the weight of cargo on a ship by measuring the vessel's draft—the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the hull—before and after loading or unloading. By accounting for the ship’s displacement and adjusting for factors like water density and ballast, the survey provides an accurate measure of cargo weight.

Draft Survey Formula:
Cargo Weight = (Load Displacement  -Net Displacement) 
```

## Why Use a Draft Survey?

Draft surveys are essential for ensuring accurate cargo weight calculations, which are critical for commercial transactions, safety, and compliance with maritime regulations. Key benefits include:

- **Accuracy**: Provides precise cargo weight measurements, reducing disputes in trade.
- **Safety**: Ensures the vessel is loaded within safe stability and weight limits.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Helps verify cargo quantities for billing and logistics, minimizing financial discrepancies.

## How to Conduct a Draft Survey

To perform a draft survey, follow these steps:

1. **Measure Initial Draft**: Record the vessel’s draft marks at multiple points (forward, midship, and aft) before loading or unloading.
2. **Account for Conditions**: Note environmental factors like water density, temperature, and salinity, as these affect displacement calculations.
3. **Measure Final Draft**: After loading or unloading, take draft readings again.
4. **Calculate Displacement**: Use the ship’s hydrostatic tables to determine displacement based on draft measurements.
5. **Apply Adjustments**: Subtract ballast, fuel, and other non-cargo weights to isolate the cargo weight.

Example tools and resources:
- Draft survey software or calculators
- Hydrometers for water density
- Ship’s displacement tables

## Conclusion

A draft survey is a vital tool in maritime operations, ensuring accurate cargo weight calculations for safety and commercial purposes. This post has introduced the basics of draft surveys and their importance in the shipping industry.
